/*
Figure out whether the given words can form a circular chain. Assume that single word can never form a chain.

Two words can be chained together if the first word's last letter is equal to the second word's first letter. We are given a list of words and we need to figure out if all these words can be chained together or not.  Let's assume that all words are lower case.

[eve, eat, ripe, tear];
