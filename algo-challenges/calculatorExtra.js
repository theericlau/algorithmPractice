I forget exactly what they called the calculator, but the question was essentially to code a RPN calculator that incorporates parenthesis and an indeterminate amount of numbers per operation (where as RPN will always be only two numbers per operation). An example being "( add 1 ( mul 3 4 ) )" = 13.
