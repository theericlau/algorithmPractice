/*
Given an array of integers,

fnd the highest
product you can get from three of the integers.
The input arrayOfInts will always have at least three integers.

Gotchas
Does your function work with negative numbers? If arrayOfInts is [−10, −10, 1, 3, 2] we should
return 300 (which we get by taking −10 ∗ −10 ∗ 3).
We can do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.
