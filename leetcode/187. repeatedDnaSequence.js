/*
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG".When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Write a function to find all the 10 - letter - long sequences(substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

For example,

  Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

    Return:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function (s) {
  //loop into strings
    //store every substring in hash
    //if exists then increment in hash
  //loop in hash to check which dna has multiple
  //return list
};
